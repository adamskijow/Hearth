# Configuration reference

Hearth reads a single JSON file. The default location is
`~/Library/Application Support/Hearth/config.json`; set `HEARTH_CONFIG` to point
at another file (handy for a throwaway config). Decoding is lenient: every key is
optional and missing keys fall back to the defaults below, so a partial or empty
`{}` still works. Edit it from the Preferences window or by hand; either way, Save
or `hearth` with `SIGHUP` (or the menu's Reload Config) applies it without a
restart.

Run `hearth doctor` after editing to catch problems (bad ports, an unknown runner
or mode, a control endpoint with no token, timings that cannot grow).

## Runner

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `runner` | string | `"ollama"` | Which runner to supervise: `ollama`, `lmstudio`, or `mlx`. |
| `mode` | string | `"managed"` | `managed` (Hearth launches and owns the runner) or `attached` (Hearth only watches a runner you start yourself). |
| `ollamaBinaryPath` | string | `"/opt/homebrew/bin/ollama"` | Path to the `ollama` binary (managed Ollama). |
| `lmStudioBinaryPath` | string | `"/usr/local/bin/lms"` | Path to the `lms` CLI (managed LM Studio). |
| `mlxBinaryPath` | string | `"/opt/homebrew/bin/mlx_lm.server"` | Path to `mlx_lm.server` (managed mlx_lm). |
| `host` | string | `"127.0.0.1"` | Address the runner serves on. `127.0.0.1` keeps it on this machine. |
| `port` | int | `11434` | Port the runner serves on (Ollama's default is 11434). |

## Health and restart policy

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `probeTimeoutSeconds` | number | `2` | How long a readiness probe waits before it counts as a failure. |
| `probeIntervalSeconds` | number | `5` | How often to probe while healthy. |
| `startupGraceSeconds` | number | `30` | How long to allow for the runner to come up before treating it as failed. |
| `startupProbeIntervalSeconds` | number | `1` | Probe cadence during startup and restart. |
| `initialBackoffSeconds` | number | `1` | Wait before the first restart attempt. |
| `backoffMultiplier` | number | `2` | Each failed restart multiplies the wait by this (clamped to at least 1). |
| `maxBackoffSeconds` | number | `60` | Upper limit on the restart wait. |
| `crashLoopThreshold` | int | `5` | Failures within the window that trip the crash-loop brake (clamped to at least 1). |
| `crashLoopWindowSeconds` | number | `60` | Sliding window for counting failures toward the brake. |
| `failingProbeIntervalSeconds` | number | `30` | Slow, steady retry cadence once in the crash-loop (failing) state. |

## Notifications

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `localNotifications` | bool | `true` | Show a macOS notification on down/recovered (needs a logged-in session and a signed app). |
| `ntfyTopic` | string or null | `null` | Subscribe to this topic in the [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) app for phone alerts. Null disables ntfy. |
| `ntfyServer` | string | `"https://ntfy.sh"` | ntfy server URL. |

## Control endpoint (phone-side remote control)

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `controlEnabled` | bool | `false` | Serve a small HTTP API so a phone can check status and start/stop/restart. |
| `controlHost` | string | `"127.0.0.1"` | Address the control endpoint binds to. Use a private or Tailscale address, never `0.0.0.0` on the open internet. |
| `controlPort` | int | `11435` | Control endpoint port. Must differ from `port`. |
| `controlToken` | string or null | `null` | Required bearer token on every control request. The endpoint refuses to start without one. |

See [reverse-proxy.md](reverse-proxy.md) for exposing the runner or the control
endpoint with TLS.

## Runner log rotation

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `logMaxBytes` | int | `5000000` | Rotate `runner.log` once it grows past this many bytes. `0` disables rotation. |
| `logKeepFiles` | int | `3` | How many rotated log files to keep before deleting the oldest. |

## Example

A minimal managed-Ollama config with phone control over Tailscale:

```json
{
  "runner": "ollama",
  "mode": "managed",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 11434,
  "ntfyTopic": "my-private-hearth-topic",
  "controlEnabled": true,
  "controlHost": "100.x.y.z",
  "controlPort": 11435,
  "controlToken": "a-long-random-secret"
}
```
